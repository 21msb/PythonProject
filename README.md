# TuwaiqBot 

**TuwaiqBot** is a chatbot web-based that enables Tuwaiq Academy users to know what's new in the academy, what are the available bootcams, programs, and new events. It can help the users who want to join as a trainee to apply fast, and ask us about anything directly. 
This idea helps users to access anything directly without taking time to search in the website.

## What does the TuwaiqBot provide?
1. The user can select what option he/she want to know about it, e.g bootcamps or programs or events.
2. The user can select one of them and see the list of availablity bootcamps or programs or event.
3. The content of each selection will provide the details of them.
4. The user also can fill a form to contact directly with the academy.
5. If the user want to join as a trainee in the academy, he/she can select the option join as a trainee.
